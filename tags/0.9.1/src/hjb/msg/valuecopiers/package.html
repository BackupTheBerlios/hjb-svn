Provides the interface and classes needed to allow values to be read
and written from the properties of JMS messages.

<p>
<code>EncodedValueCopier</code> defines the methods for reading and
writing encoded values to and from JMS Message properties.  There are
implementations of this interface to support boolean, char, byte,
short, int, long, double, float and string property values.  All the
implementations are actually subclasses of {@link
hjb.msg.valuecopiers.BaseEncodedValueCopier}, which provides various
utility methods used by all, as well as standard implementations of
methods in {@link java.lang.Object}.
</p>

<p>
<code>OrderedPropertyValueCopier</code> is an implementation of the
<code>EncodedValueCopier</code> interface that combines all the other
implementations in this package and should be used when the type to be 
read/written is unknown.
