Provides the classes and interface needed to allow values of various
Java types encountered in JMS messages to be encoded into and decoded
from strings that are suitable for inclusion in either the body or
headers of a HTTP message.

<p>
<code>TypeValueCodec</code> defines the methods required for encoding
and decoding any type.  There are implementations of this interface to
support boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, byte array, double,
float and string values.  All implementations in this package are
actually subclasses of {@link hjb.msg.codec.BaseValueCodec}, which
provides various utility methods used by all, and standard
implementations of methods of {@link java.lang.Object}.
</p>

<p>
<code>OrderedTypedValueCodec</code> is an implementation of the
<code>TypeValueCodec</code> interface that combines all the other
implementations in this package and should be used when the type to be
encoded/decoded is unknown.
