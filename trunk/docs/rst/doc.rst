Documentation
=============

As with any open source project, HJB's documentation lags at little
bit behind its development!

However, there is quite of it available, and most of the information
you'll need to get started is here. Please `get in touch`_ if there is
something obvious that is missing.

* `Installation guide`_

* `Design notes`_

* Javadocs_ 

.. _Installation guide: ./installation.html

.. _Javadocs: http://hjb.tigris.org/to/be/done

.. _Design notes: ./detailed-design.html
