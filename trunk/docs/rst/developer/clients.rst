Clients
=======

At the moment, while HJB itself is beta and is being tested and
improved, a python client for HJB, PyHJB_ is also being produced.  For
now, it is the only client, but many languages have good HTTP
libraries, so we hope for more in the future.

PyHJB
-----

PyHJB is a `pure python library`_ for accessing HJB servers. It
provides a pythonic API to JMS, and comes with a number of utility
scripts that can be used test HJB servers.
