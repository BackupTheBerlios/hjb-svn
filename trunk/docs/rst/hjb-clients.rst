**2006/11/17** At the moment, HJB is still being tested and
improved. A python client for HJB, PyHJB_ has been developed and
successfully accesses `JMS`_ systems using HJB.  So far, PyHJB_ is the
only HJB client. However, many programming languages have good HTTP
client libraries, so watch this space for other HJB clients in the
near future.

PyHJB
-----

`PyHJB`_ is a pure `Python`_ library for accessing JMS messaging
providers over `HTTP`_ using HJB's `RESTful`_ API.  It provides a
'pythonic' API to `JMS`_.  The PyHJB distribution includes scripts
that can be used to demo the capabilites of HJB.
