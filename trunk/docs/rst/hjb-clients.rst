**2006/05/06** At the moment, HJB is still being tested and
improved. A python client for HJB, PyHJB_ is under development and is
used in the functional testing of HJB.  So far, PyHJB is the only HJB
client. However, many programming languages have good HTTP client
libraries, so watch this space for other HJB clients in the near
future.

PyHJB

`PyHJB`_ is a pure python library for accessing JMS messaging
providers via HJB servers.  It provides a 'pythonic' API to JMS.  The
PyHJB distribution includes scripts that can be used to demo the
capabilites of HJB.
