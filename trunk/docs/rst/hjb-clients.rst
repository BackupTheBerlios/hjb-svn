**2006/04/06** At the moment, HJB itself is still in beta and is being
tested and improved. A python client for HJB, PyHJB_ is also being
developed, and is used extensively for functional testing HJB.  For
now, it is the only HJB client. Many languages have good HTTP
libraries, so watch this space for new ones in the future.

provides a pythonic API to JMS, and comes with a number of utility
scripts that can be used test a HJB server is working correctly with a
