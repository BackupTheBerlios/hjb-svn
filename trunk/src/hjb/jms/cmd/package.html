Provides the interface and classes used to encapsulate the dispatch 
of invocation of various JMS API methods on the JMS objects contained 
by HJB.

<p>
Each <code>JMSCommand</code> is used to invoke a particular method of
the JMS API, and reporting on the success or failure of the call.  
There are implementations of this interface to cover invocation of all 
of the JMS API methods supported by HJB.  The classes all extend from 
<code>BaseJMSCommand</code>.
</p>

<p>
<code>JMSCommandRunner</code> is a {@link java.lang.Runnable} that is
used queue <code>JMSCommands</code> for execution in a separate thread.
